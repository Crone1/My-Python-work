This repostiroy contains a number of differeny Python program's that I developed outside of college to continue my learning of the language.

There are 5 main projects here:
- A lotto simulator
- A poker hand analyser
- A class for storing my grades
- A quadratic equation solver
- A cubic equation solver

I decided to develop the first two on this list (lotto simulator & poker hand analyser) to further develop on excercises that I had done in college. I was interested in these excercises in particular and wanted to code something up that was bigger and better than what was requested by the college.

The class for storing my grades was also a development on an excercise done for college. Here I tailored this excercise for my grades in particular.

The quadratic equation solver was somethign that I developed as I wanted to keep up programming and create something over my christmas break. I originally developed this in python 2 as I did not know Python 3 at the time, however, after learning python 3, I created a python 3 version of this program.

Th cubic equation solver was the next step up after I had developed my quadratic equation solver. I developed this during the summer so that I would keep my programming skills up to date and would further develop them outside of college. This programme involved more complex logic than the standard quadratic equation solver which proved an interesting challenge.
